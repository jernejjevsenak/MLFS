Dear CRAN

this is a resubmission of the R package MLFS. I have received the first comments
from CRAN with the instructions and suggestions for improvement. I would like to
thank you for your time and effort in reviewing my package. I have implemented 
all the suggestions and am now resubmitting the updated and corrected version. 
Please read my responses and described actions below. I have also performed all
the necessary tests listed at the end of this message.

The incoming NOTE about “Possibly misspelled words” refers to proper nouns 
(Krajnc) and the package acronym (MLFS).

Best,
Jernej
